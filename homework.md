1. In IT what is a server and what is a proxy server? (1p)

Proxy servers which are either systems or routers, which give gateway access between the user and the internet. An example would be HTTP server - HTTP gives user access to the web. 

# Edits and comments
* A server is a computer program or device providing a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client. 
* A erver stores, sends and receives data. ie: it "serves" something else and exists to provide services.
* A computer, software program, or even a storage device may act as a server, and it may provide one service or several
* Types of servers include: Web server, Proxy server, Virtual Machine, File server etc. 
* A proxy server is a bridge between you and the rest of the internet.
* In everyday use, the word “proxy” refers to someone who is authorized to take an action on your behalf.A proxy server fills the same role, but online. 
* Proxy servers play a significant role in cyber security


2. What is a CPU and how does it work? (1p)

C - Central P - Process(ing) U - Unit; it allows the computer to process and store  data, input results and also output results, - whatever instruction given to the computer via program, it will do. CPU basically works by following simple instructions and executing them. 

3. What is RAM and what are differences between CPU and RAM? (1p)

R-Random A-Access M-Memory; this is where data is kept for short term memory - this is for the processor.
RAM keeps the data & CPU does the input / output etc it does the instruction part so the computing 
E.g if you input red and blue = purple, thats the CPU and it gets that info from RAM


4. What is an OS (operating system), can a computer work without an OS? (1p)

OS - it is the system software that deals with computer programs, computer hardware and system resources
It is impossible for a computer to work without an OS, without OS it can not run and execute programs. No OS means no computer hardware or software. 

5. Describe what is a Computer Network? (1p)

it is basically a set of computers that share data and resources - so they receive, transmit and swap data. 

# Note: 
## networked devices use a set of rules (communications protocols) to transmit information over physical or wireless media.

6. What is a web server port? (1p)

in simple terms it is a communication end point. they swap info between web servers and the web client. the most common ports are port 80 and port 443.

7. What is TCP and its services? (1p)

T- Transmition C-Control - P-Protocol; allowing programs and computers to swap data over network. so delivers data through bytes and receives data through bytes 

# note:
* TCP/IP, in full Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, standard Internet communications protocols that allow digital computers to communicate over long distances.
* It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.
* TCP offers a full-duplex service where the data can flow in both directions simultaneously. Each TCP will then have a sending buffer and receiving buffer.


8. What is a Command Line (command line interface CLI) (1p)

We use CLI to run programs, keep managment of files and give the computer instructions and interact with it - we input command prompts in the CLI such as "mkdir" which creates a directory.  

9. Difference between console, command line (CLI), terminal and Shell (1p)

Console - it is a type of terminal - it is a physical terminal 
Command Line - this is a type of interface, allowing the user to enter commands, e.g the terminal is a command line
Terminal - is an enviroment that allows users to input instructions and it outputs resultd, we can interact with the shell through this
Shell - interpets the command line - the UI of shell allows the user to interact with the OS. 

What is Linux? 1(p)

it is an open source operating system

* Linux is a Unix-like open-source computer operating system (OS) that directly manages hardware and resources of a system such as CPU, memory, and storage, and manages the communication between software and hardware.
* Linux is an open source operating system whereas Windows OS is commercial.
* Linux has access to source code and alters the code as per user need whereas Windows does not have access to the source code. 
* In Linux, the user has access to the source code of the kernel and can alter the code according to his/her needs.
